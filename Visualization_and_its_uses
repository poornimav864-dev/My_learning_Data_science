Matplotlib and Seaborn are the two most popular Python libraries for data visualization.

Matplotlib → low-level, customizable, foundation library.
Use Matplotlib for pie charts, custom subplots, and fine-tuned styling.

Seaborn → high-level, statistical, beautiful defaults.
Use Seaborn for box plots, heatmaps, pair plots (cleaner defaults).

For my visualization assignment, i have used all seven (pie, bar, hist, box, scatter, pair, heatmap)
because it shows variety and covers both categorical and numerical insights.

1. Pie chart → proportions, small categories.
Used to Show proportions of categories within a whole. Works best with 2–6 categories.
Example: Survival distribution (Survived vs Not Survived),
         Gender split (Male vs Female),
         Passenger class proportions (1st, 2nd, 3rd).

2. Bar chart → categorical comparisons.
Compare counts or averages across categories. Easy to interpret.
Example: Survival rate by Sex, Survival rate by Pclass, Average Fare by Embarked port.

3. Histogram → numeric distributions.
Used to Show distribution of a single numeric variable. Highlights skewness, spread, and frequency.
Example: Age distribution of passengers, Fare distribution.

4. Box plot → spread + outliers.
Used to Show spread, median, quartiles, and outliers of numeric data across categories.
Example: Age distribution by Survival, Fare distribution by Pclass.

5. Scatter plot → numeric relationships.
Show relationship between two numeric variables. Useful for spotting trends or clusters.
Example: Fare vs Age, Age vs SibSp (siblings/spouses aboard).

6. Pair plot → multi-variable exploration.
Show relationships among multiple numeric variables at once, with distributions on the diagonal.
Example: Age, Fare, SibSp, Parch with hue='Survived' to see survival patterns.

7. Heatmap → correlations or intensity patterns.
Show correlations or intensity values in a matrix format.
Example: Correlation heatmap of numeric features (Age, Fare, SibSp, Parch, Survived).
