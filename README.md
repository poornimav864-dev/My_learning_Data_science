Data Cleaning:
Handling Missing Values: Drop rows/columns with too many missing values.
Impute with mean, median, mode, or advanced methods (KNN imputer).
Removing Duplicates: Ensures no repeated records.
Data Transformation :
Encoding Categorical Variables:Label Encoding → converts categories into numbers.
One-Hot Encoding → creates binary columns for each category.
Scaling Numerical Features:Standardization (Z-score) → mean = 0, std = 1.
Normalization (Min-Max) → values scaled between 0 and 1.
Data Splitting :
Train-Test Split: Typically 70–80% for training, 20–30% for testing.
Model: Regression and make predictions
Evaluating metrics: R2 score, MAE
